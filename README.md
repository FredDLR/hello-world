# hello-world

My name is Fred D. and I am very excited to have discovered the world of Open Source programming.
I would like to use Github to contribute to projects and give back to the community, while also learning to code.

I look forward to meeting you and will do my best to listen to and learn from you all. 
Please feel free to message me with any thoughts, concerns, or just to say hello!

To start, I want to share a rudimentary program I discovered when playing around with ChatGPT.
It is a basic Python program I had ChatGPT write for me to play Tic Tac Toe. 
The program is not very impressive in scale, but it is extremely impressive because of what ChatGPT actaully did.
ChatGPT engineered a program for me!

In the end of 2023, I have used Python to engineer and reverse engineer programs for me, which it does with no problems!
It has created songs which would take hours to create, in seconds. 
I have used it to explain code and legal documents to me in a way a child could understand.
The impressive part, I feel, is that this is just the beginning of what AI is capable of doing.

I present to you the game "Chicken Scratch" written in Python.
