# hello-world

My name is Fred D. and I am very excited to have discovered the world of Open Source programming.
I would like to use Github to contribute to projects and give back to the community, while also learning to build programs myself.

I look forward to meeting you and will do my best to listen to and learn from you all. 
Please feel free to message me with any thoughts, concerns, or just to say hello!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start, I want to share a rudimentary program I discovered when playing around with ChatGPT.
It is a basic Python program I had ChatGPT write for me to play Tic Tac Toe. 
The program is not very impressive in scale, but it is extremely impressive because of what ChatGPT actaully did.

ChatGPT engineered a program for me!

In the end of 2023, I have used ChatGPT4 to create and explain what programs are doing, which it does with no problems!
It has created songs which would take hours to create, in seconds. 
I have used it to explain code and legal documents to me in a way a child could understand.
The impressive part, I feel, is that this is just the beginning of what AI is ultimately going to be capable of doing.

I present to you the game "Chicken Scratch" written in Python. It is basically a caveman version of Tic Tac Toe, written by ChatGPT, and directed by me. 
Ideally, I would like to add open source sounds of chickens into the game. Animations, sound effects, and music can take a very lack luster program, and turn it into a fun, exciting Video Game! I have to give the example of Minecraft. Minecraft should be the most boring game anyone has ever played because it is such a primitive video game. I mean, the graphics are terrible! Thanks to the sound effects, and music, I am willing to bet any child that you konw loves to play the game. And if you know a kid that does not know about Minecraft, I feel sorry for that kid because he or she does not know the joy of searching for and mining diamonds!

I dare you to listen to the Minecraft song C418's "Sweden", it will haunt your dreams!:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBkTkxKDduc. 

If anyone knows how to add effects to this program, please let me know. If not, then I will return to having copilot heLP me figure out coding. *I have taken a coding class for C++, but I wil admit that I am NOT a coder. I am merely using the tools as I see fit. This is a part of why I am so excited, ANYONE can do this*

The Red Pill for today:
#Romans 10:8 ESV "because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
#Saved from what? One might ask. I believe from death, the void, meaningless-ness. Earth is a program matrix created by God, controlled by satan. If we beat the game, we make it into heaven. And all it takes is to believe Jesus Christ died on the cross for us. No-thing else will suffice. What a gift!
