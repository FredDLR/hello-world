INTRO: 

My name is Fred D. and I am very excited to have discovered the world of Open Source programming.
I would like to use Github to contribute to projects and give back to the community, while also learning to build programs myself.

I look forward to meeting you and will do my best to listen to and learn from you all. 
Please feel free to message me with any thoughts, concerns, or just to say hello!
To start, I want to share a rudimentary program I discovered when playing around with ChatGPT.
It is a basic Python program I had ChatGPT write for me to play Tic Tac Toe. 
The program is not very impressive in size or complexity, but it is extremely impressive to me because of what ChatGPT actaully did.

ChatGPT engineered a program for me!

In the end of 2023, I have used ChatGPT4 to create and explain what programs are doing, which it does with no problems!
It has created songs which potentially could take a lot longer to create, in seconds. 
I have used it to explain code and legal documents to me in a way a child could understand.
The impressive part, I feel, is that this is just the beginning of what AI is ultimately going to be capable of doing.

I present to you the game "Chicken Scratch" written in Python. It is basically a caveman version of Tic Tac Toe, written by ChatGPT. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TASK:

If anyone knows how to add sound and visual effects to this program, please let me know. If not, then I will return to having copilot help me figure out coding. Ideally, I would like to add open source sounds of chickens into the game. Chicken SCRATCH sounds when one marks an X, and chicken PECK sounds, when one marks an O. I would like to add background chicken noises to make it feel like we are playing this game in a barn.

THE CRAFT:

Animations, sound effects, and music can take a very lack luster program, and turn it into a fun, exciting Video Game! I have to give the example of Minecraft. Minecraft should be the most boring game anyone has ever played because it is such a primitive video game. I mean, the graphics are horrible! Thanks to the sound effects, and music, I am willing to bet any child that you konw LOVES to play Minecraft. 

I dare you to listen to the Minecraft song C418's "Sweden", it will haunt your dreams!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBkTkxKDduc.

THE RED PILL: 

Romans 10:9 ESV "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
# Saved from what? One might ask. I believe from death, the void, meaningless-ness of life, The Matrix. Earth is a program engineered by God, controlled by satan. If we beat the game, we make it into heaven. And all it takes is to believe Jesus Christ died on the cross for us. No-thing else will suffice. What a gift!

James 4:4 KJV "Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
# I never did like the "Hello World" program, it implies that when you write the program is when you first say hello to the world. When you fell out of your mom's vagina is the first time you said hello to the world.
